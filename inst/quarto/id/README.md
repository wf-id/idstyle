## Installing

This will be installed when you start a new project using the RStudio wizard: File > New Project > New Directory > ID Research Project Template and select Quarto Report or Quarto Dashboard as one of your desired outputs.

For a Quarto Report, the wizard will install the extension in the `report/` folder and create an `report/index.qmd` file that you can use as a starting place for a html/docx/pdf report.


For a Quarto Dashboard, the wizard will install the extension in the `dashboard/` folder and create an `dashboard/index.qmd` file that you can use as a starting place for a dashboard.
