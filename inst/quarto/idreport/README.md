# ID Report Format

## Installing

This will be installed when you start a new project using the RStudio wizard: File > New Project > New Directory > ID Research Project Template and select Quarto Report as one of your desired outputs.

This will install the extension and create an `report/report.qmd` file that you can use as a starting place for your report.
